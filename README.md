# MiniRel
A simplified single-user relational database system  
  
The whole system consists of four subsystems: the Catalog, where metadata information
is kept, the Storage Manager, which takes care of the page allocation and deallocation,
the Buffer Manager, which takes care of the page fetching in memory and the formersâ€™
flushing out to disk and the Query Processing System, which implements some relational
operators.
