***** INTRO ********
********************

To make sure you are on the right track, we have provided
some basic sanity check test cases. 

These test cases are NOT comprehensive, and the autograder
will have hidden test cases that we have not yet tested. 

If there is ANY difference in your output (include page reads etc), 
there is something likely wrong with your code. Be sure you are not
adding any extra spaces etc

***************************
******* INSTRUCTIONS ******
***************************

We have provided two sets of files:
- .sql files --> Specify SQL commands to be run
- .out files --> Specify the output for the corresponding SQL file

To test your project, you are to run the following commands:

1. Run 'make' command to create executables for the project
2. Create a new database using 'dbcreate'.
3. Run 'minirel' command with the database you creates
   and one of the '.sql' files we provided. Be sure to redirect
   output to a file of your own name
4. Diff the output of your file with the '.out' file we provided.
   Be sure to diff with the '.out' file that matches '.sql'

***************************
****** EXAMPLE USAGE ******
***************************

Example for running insert_1.sql:
1. `make`
2. `./dbcreate myDB`
3. `./minirel myDB insert_1.sql > my_insert_1.out`
4. `diff my_insert_1.out insert_1.out`
